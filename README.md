# Banana-Leaf-Disease-Detection

This project was developed using tensorflow model to detect the type of disease that has affected the banana leaves. The model was trained on suffient amount of images and saved to make predictions on the user image.
The saved model is integrated to a web interface using python flask to provide end-user experience.
